    <h2>Preamble</h2>
    
    <p><a href = "http://soh.am">I</a> have a simple political philosophy: more freedom, not less. In particular, this means more freedom for the little guy, for the independent thinker, the protestor, the iconoclast, the conscientious objecter -- dissent <em>must not</em> be grounds for persecution, much less prosecution, and difference <em>must not</em> lead to discrimination.</p>
    <p>I built this page after observing a repeated pattern of behaviour: I read or hear about some law or custom that obviously runs counter to those ideals, get worked up about it for a few days, then forget the exact details after I find the next fucked up thing. At the end of many, many iterations of this cycle, I'm left only with a lot of unresolved residual anger and have done very little to fix the underlying issues.</p>
    <p>This list is an attempt to catalogue each of these fucked up things as I find them, as well as to track efforts to fix them.</p>

    <h2>The Issues</h2>
    
    <h3>Issue #01: Civil Forfeiture</h3>
    <aside>aka civil asset foreiture, civil seizure, civil judicial forfeiture.<aside>

    <p><strong>What the fuck is this?</strong></p>
    <p>Civil forfeiture laws allow police to sieze and sell any property they claim is involved in a crime. No criminal charge or conviction of the owner of said property is required.</p>
    <p>TODO: Add sources</p>
    <p><strong>Where is this a problem?</strong></p>
    <p>The United States - in particular, Alabama, Alaska, Delaware, Illinois, Massachusetts, Missouri, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Wyoming, Georgia, South Dakota and Washington.</p>
    <p><strong>Who gets this right?</strong></p>
    <p>New Mexico and Nebraska - civil forefeiture is abolshished under state law... except it seems like police might just be <a href = "http://www.npr.org/2016/06/07/481058641/new-mexico-ended-civil-asset-forfeiture-why-then-is-it-still-happening">ignoring those laws, at least in New Mexico</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Why is this evil?</strong></p>
    <p>Put simply, this is legalized theft - the police accuse you of intending to commit a crime, take your money, then put that money into the a police department slush fund. A number of police departments have been found to openly have a quota system in place to encourage and even require these seizures. A lot of those departments rely on such seizures as their main sources of funding.</p>
    <p><strong>What can I do?</strong></p>
    <p>TODO: add the what can I do section.</p>
    <p><strong>Where can I read more about this?</strong></p>

    <h2>Epilogue</h2>
    
    <p>Useful links: the <a href="http://aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Unions</a> (ACLU) does a phenomenal job of fighting for individual freedom in the US, while the <a href = "http://eff.org">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> (EFF) does a great job with technology law stuff of a similar nature, though the total efforts of those and similar organizations are woefully inadeqaute given the scale and variety of the issues they're charged with tackling.</p>
