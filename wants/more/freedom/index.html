    <h2>Preamble</h2>
    
    <p><a href = "http://soh.am">I</a> have a simple political philosophy: more freedom, not less. In particular, this means more freedom for the little guy, for the independent thinker, the protestor, the iconoclast, the conscientious objecter -- dissent <em>must not</em> be grounds for persecution, much less prosecution, and difference <em>must not</em> lead to discrimination.</p>
    <p>I built this page after observing a repeated pattern of behaviour: I read or hear about some law or custom that obviously runs counter to those ideals, get worked up about it for a few days, then forget the exact details after I find the next fucked up thing. At the end of many, many iterations of this cycle, I'm left only with a lot of unresolved residual anger and have done very little to fix the underlying issues.</p>
    <p>This list is an attempt to catalogue each of these fucked up things as I find them, as well as to track efforts to fix them.</p>
