    <h2>Preamble</h2>
    
    <p><a href = "http://soh.am">I</a> have a simple political philosophy: more freedom, not less. In particular, this means more freedom for the little guy, for the independent thinker, the protestor, the iconoclast, the conscientious objecter -- dissent <em>must not</em> be grounds for persecution, difference <em>must not</em> lead to discrimination.</p>
    <p>I built this page after observing a repeated pattern of behaviour: I read or hear about some law or custom that obviously runs counter to those ideals, get worked up about it for a few days, then forget the exact details after I find the next fucked up thing. At the end of many, many iterations of this cycle, I'm left only with a lot of unresolved residual anger and have done very little to fix the underlying issues.</p>
    <p>This list is an attempt to catalogue each of these fucked up things as I find them, as well as to track efforts to fix them.</p>

    <p><strong>7 fucking declarations.</strong></p>

    <p>
      That's how much CSS it took to turn that <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">grotesque pile of shit</a> into this easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it <em>still</em> has all the glory of the original perfect-ass website:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Shit's <em>still</em> lightweight and loads fast</li>
      <li><em>Still</em> fits on all your shitty screens</li>
      <li><em>Still</em> looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
      <li>The motherfucker's <em>still</em> accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
      <li>Shit's <em>still</em> legible and gets your fucking point across</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>And guess what, motherfucker:</h3>

    <p>
      You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how
    </p>
    
    <h2>Let it breathe</h2>

    <p>
      Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum <code>line-height: 1.4</code> for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that...piss off.
    </p>

    <p>
      If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that? Yes? What a shitty book.
    </p>

    <h2>A little less contrast</h2>

    <p>
      Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice <code>#EEEEEE</code> if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.
    </p>

    <h2>Size Matters</h2>

    <p>
      I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close to 16px or more. Smaller type works well for print, not the screen.
    </p>

    <h2>Line-width, motherfucker</h2>

    <p>
      Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's 200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentence of your worthless dribble.
    </p>

    <h3>Yes, this is <em>also</em> fucking satire, you fuck</h3>

    <p>
      I love what the creator of <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">this site's inspiration</a> did. What I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit.
